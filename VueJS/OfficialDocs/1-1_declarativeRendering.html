<!-- The first Vue.js tutorial. Lets get started. Vue is being chosen over react-js because its wayyyyy easier
	and makes way more sense. -->

<!-- For the sake of simplicity, we're going to just load everything in a regular HTML file and see how everything works -->

<!-- Also we're using the unminified version of Vue.js because it spits out
	any error you might want to see. -->

<!-- First example -->
<div id="app">
	{{ message }}
</div>

<!-- Second Example -->
<div id="app-2">
	<span v-bind:title="message">
		Hover your mouse over me for a few seconds to see my dynamically bound title!
	</span>
</div>

<!--  2nd Example:
	So thats fucking cool. I binded the message property that vue will output into 
	the HTML attribute "title" to show the time on hover. I can put "class", and set
	the data to whatever I want. SO FUCKIN COOL. Just use v-bind directive. Vue.js
	has many directives, and they all start with v-.

<script>
// First Example
var app = new Vue({
	el: '#app', // el is for element
	data: {
		message: 'Hello Vue!'
	}
})

// Second Example
var app2 = new Vue({
	el: '#app-2',
	data: {
		message: 'You loaded this page on ' + new Date()
	}
})

<!-- 1st Example:
	So very simple. We declaratively rendered data to the DOM, making it "Reactive". 
	What this means is that the JS data and DOM are linked. You can actually see this by 
	opening up the JS console and setting app.message. Everything is realtime! 
	(This is way nicer than react honestly)
