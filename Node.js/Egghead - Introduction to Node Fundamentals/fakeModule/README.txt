So process for creating a module is pretty simple:

1. Create a new directory, go on terminal and change directory into it
2. Type "npm init" to create a package.json automatically and fill out the information
3. Depending on the "main" file you set during npm init, that is where the code will be run
4. Thats it. Include it into your projects!
