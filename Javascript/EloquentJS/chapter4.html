			// So lets begin by creating an array/data set
			var listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];
			console.log(listOfNumbers); // Output all the elements declared in the array
			console.log(listOfNumbers[1]); // Output the second element. *Remember, 0 counts as an index.
			console.log(listOfNumbers[1-1]); //Output the first element, because it calculates to index 0.
			console.log(listOfNumbers.length); // Output the number of elements in the array

			/* Now lets go over properties! Remember some of these:

			x.length, x.max -> These are properties that the variable can have. Only null doesn't have any properties.
			You can use either a value.x and value[x] to access a property on value, but they may not necassarily be the
			same property. The difference is that theres a ".", the property must be a variable name, while the property
			within brackets can be evaluated. Elements of an array are stored in properties. We can use array.length to
			figure out how many elements are in an array, similar to the way it finds how many characters are in a string.
			According to the rules above, you can write it as array["length"], but thats unneccessary in this case.
			*/

			// Now lets cover methods
			/* Both strings and array obects contain not only the length property, but a number of different methods as
				well. Here is an example below */
			var doh = "Doh";
			console.log(typeof doh.toUpperCase); // Should output (function)
			console.log(doh.toUpperCase()); // Should output DOH

			/* Properties that contain functions are called "methods" of the value they belong, so its a method of "doh".
				Every string object has toUpperCase and toLowerCase methods, and a host of other different properties
			*/
			// Now lets cover some different methods that can be used with array objects
			var collection = [];
			collection.push("Mack"); // The push method adds an element into the array in sequential order
			collection.push("the", "Knife");
			console.log(collection); // Output should be -> ["Mack", "the", "Knife"]
			console.log(collection.join(" ")); // Join determines the text that is glues between an array's elements.
											   // So the output should be -> Mack the Knife
			console.log(collection.pop()); // Pop removes the value at the end of the array, and returns it, so the output should be -> Knife
			console.log(collection); // Output the remaining array, which should be -> ["Mack", "the"]

			// Now lets cover objects!
			/* Objects contain arbitrary collections of properties. We can add and remove properties as necassary. */
			// Here is a small example
			var david = {
				graduate: false,
				age: 22,
				school: "FAU",
				skills: ["Programming", "Music", "Audio Production"]
			}; // Observe the syntax of declaring an object
			console.log("David Cardoso's Education Profile:")
			console.log("Age: " + david.age); // Output age property of "david" object. Which should be -> 22
			console.log("Currently attending " + david.school);
			console.log("Has skills in " + david.skills.join(" ")); // Remove the default array formatting using join
			console.log("Graduate?: " + david.graduate);

			david.graduate = true; // Change the property "graduate" on the "david" object
			console.log("Graduate error...Refreshing info status: " + david.graduate); //Print updated "graduate" property
			/* So its pretty simple. Remember when reading a property that doesn't exist, the value is undefined.
				You can both create or assign a value to a property using an "=" sign. So doing for example:
				var david.weight = 250; would create a new property weight, and set it to 250!

				Now lets delete a property from the "david" object */
			delete david.age; // Delete the age property from the "david" object
			console.log(david.age); // It should now output undefined because the property has been deleted
			console.log("graduate" in david); // the "in" operator returns a boolean value to indicate if an object has a property. Output should be -> true
			console.log("age" in david); // Output should be -> false

			// So arrays are then objects specialized for storing sequences of data.
			console.log(typeof [1, 2]); // Get typeof a small array, it should output -> object
			/* So that means the "david" object is basically an array of objects and can be represented like so:

				var david = [{graduate: false}, {age: 22}, {school: "FAU"}, {skills: ["Programming", "Music", "Audio Production"]}];

				But thats not very pleasant to write out or understand
			*/

			// Now lets cover Mutability
			/* In the earlier chapters, I covered data types such as numbers, strings, and booleans; these are immutable. Its not possible
				to change the value of those types. But with objects, it is possible to change the existing values of those types. */
			// Heres an example:
			var object1 = {value: 10}; // Set the "value" attribute of object1 to 10
			var object2 = object1; // Make object2 inherit the values and properties of object1
			var object3 = {value: 10}; // Set the "value" attribute of object3 to 10
			console.log(object1 == object2); // -> true 
			console.log(object1 == object3); // -> false - because object3 although has the same contents as object1, it hasn't been explicitly declared equal like object2
			object1.value = 15; // Set the value attribute of object1 to 15
			console.log(object2.value); // Since object2 is connected to object1, it will output -> 15
			console.log(object3.value); // Since object3 is seperate and it has its own value attribute, it will output -> 10

			// Now lets cover the concept called "Lycanthrope's Log" which creates a small environment to keep entries of data
			var journal = [];

			function addEntry(classes, graduate) { // Create a function to log the classes taken, and the graduation status as a boolean value!
				journal.push({ // Push to the journal object some data
					schedule: classes, // For the schedule property, push a sequence of classes given in the argument
					status: graduate // For the status property, push a boolean value of the graduate parameter, that indicates if you graduated or not
				});
			}
			// Now use the function to add some entries
			addEntry(["Art Appreciation", "English", "Biology", "English"], false);
			addEntry(["English", "Geography", "College Algebra", "Public Speaking"], false);
			addEntry(["Trigonometry", "Intro to C", "Foundations", "Pre-Calculus"], true); // The idea is to find a correlation with the data entered.
			/* A little math here to cover. Correlation is a measure of the dependence between variables and can be expressed from ranges -1, to 1.
				1 means that the variables are perfectly correlating, 0 means that the variables have no correlation, and -1 means that they are
				correlating but are opposites.
			*/

			// Now lets actually calculate correlation!
			function phi(table) {
				return (table[3] * table[0] - table[2] * table[1]) / 
					Math.sqrt((table[2] + table[3]) *
							  (table[0] + table[1]) *
							  (table[1] + table[3]) *
							  (table[0] + table[2]));
			} // This is the actual programmatic representation of the correlation formula (LOOK IT UP)
			console.log(phi([76, 9, 4, 1])); // Calculates exact correlation from the ranges -1 to 1. Output should be -> 0.068599434

			/* Now lets go back to the journal keeping function we made, aand extract a 2x2 table for a specific class in the journal, and
			   tally up how many times the event occurs in relation to graduation status */
			function hasClass(schedule, entry) { // Create a function hasClass that takes two variables and tests whether an entry contains a given college class
				return entry.schedule.indexOf(schedule) != -1; /* indexOf method finds a given value in the array(in this case the class name) and returns the index 
																	which it was found, or returns -1 if it wasn't found. So in this case, only return the index if found. 
																*/
			}

			function tableFor(classes, journal) { // Create a function tableFor that figures out which box in the table each journal entry falls intro by the specific class
				var table = [0, 0, 0, 0]; // Create a table to hold the correlations, this will be out 2x2 table
				for (var i = 0; i < journal.length; i++) { // Set i to 0, while i < # of journal entry items, increment and perform the loop
					var entry = journal[i], index = 0; // Set entry to journal[i for index number] array, set index to 0
					if (hasClass(classes, entry)) index += 1; // If hasclass the argument, add 1 to the index
					if (entry.status) index += 2; // If entry.status true, add 2 to index
					table[index] += 1; // Move to the indicated index, add 1 into the array
				}
				return table; // Return the processed table
			} // [*VOMITS]

			console.log(tableFor("English", journal)); // Output the correlations of the "English" class from the journal object
			/* Okay going to be honest, I typed this section out to hopefully understand it, but I still don't get it. Hopefully later I'll understand it. */

			// Now lets see how we can use objects as maps (whatever the hell that means)
			/* In the previous section, you saw how difficult it was to find correlations for a given college class. You have to loop the array to find the object
				with the right name. We wrapped it into a function, but it was still alot of code. A better way to do this is to use the object properties named
				after the college class types. You can use [] square bracket access notation to create and read properties and you can use the "in" operator to test
				whether a given property exists */

			var map = {}; // Create an empty object
			function storePhi(classes, phi) { // Create a function to store the correlation measure into the map object
				map[classes] = phi;
			} 
			storePhi("English", 0.5); // I have no idea why you would want to do this
			storePhi("Art Appreciation", 0.24);
			console.log("English" in map); // Okay I can see why checking if an object exists in an array can be useful. Output should be -> true
			console.log(map["English"]); // Oh okay. This is very useful, just outputting the value of the element inside the array. Output should be -> 0.5

			// Now what if you wanted to find all the events for which we have stored a coefficient. You can use a special loop construct for going over object properties
			for (var classes in map) {
				console.log("The correlation for '" + classes + "' is " + map[classes]);
			} /* Output should show -> The correlation for 'English' is 0.5
								   	   The correlation for 'Art Appreciation' is 0.24 */

			// Now lets do a final analysis of all the correlations
			/* Okay fix this later, this shit is too hard and came out wrong and isn't working
			function gatherCorrelations(journal) {
				var phis = {};
				for (var entry = 0; entry < journal.length; entry++) {
					var events = journal[entry].schedule;
					for (var i = 0; i < classes.length; i++) {
						var schedule_class = classes[i];
						if (!(classes in phis)) {
							phis[classes] = phi(tableFor(schedule_class, journal));
						}
					}
				}
				return phis;
			}
			var correlations = gatherCorrelations(journal);
			console.log(correlations.English);
			*/

			// Now lets continue with more arrayology with an extremely useful section
			/* Lets made a simple todoList. Remember that the push method adds a value at the end of the array and the pop method removes the last array item
				and returns it. Now there are two new ones, shift and unshift. "shift" method removes the element at the zero index and shifts the values down
				consecutively, returning then the removed value. "unshift" adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array, and returns the new length of 
				the array */

			var todoList = [];
			function rememberTo(task) {
				todoList.push(task); // rememberTo adds to-do list items at the end of the stack
			}
			function whatIsNext() {
				return todoList.shift();
			} // whatIsNext removes the first item from the stack and returns it to the console
			function urgentlyRememberTo(task) {
				todoList.unshift(task);
			} // urgentlyRememberTo adds a new to-do list item to the top of the stack

			// Lets use it a bit!
			rememberTo("Do the dishes"); // Add "do the dishes"
			rememberTo("Walk the dog"); // Add "walk the dog" below the previous entry
			rememberTo("Clean car"); // Add "clean the car" below previous entry. Output at this point should be -> ["Do the dishes", "Walk the dog", "Clean the car"]
			urgentlyRememberTo("Pay for car"); // Add "pay for car" at top of array
			urgentlyRememberTo("Pay for college");// Add "pay for college" at top. Output -> ["Pay for college", "Pay for car", "Do the dishes", "Walk the dog", "Clean the car"]
			whatIsNext(); // Remove the top item, so output should now be -> ["Pay for car", "Do the dishes", "Walk the dog", "Clean the car"]
			console.log(todoList);

			// Lets cover some more array methods
			console.log([1, 2, 3, 2, 5].indexOf(2)); // Return the index of the item 2, output should be -> 1
			console.log([1, 2, 3, 2, 5].lastIndexOf(2)); // Return the index of the last occured instance of the item 2, output should be -> 3
			console.log([1, 2, 3, 4, 5].slice(2, 4)); // Return any elements between indices 2 and 4, which is -> 3, 4
			console.log([1, 2, 3, 4, 5].slice(2)); // If no second argument is given to slice, it will give all elements past the index 2, output should be -> 3, 4, 5
			console.log([1, 2].concat([3, 4, 5])); // Concat glues arrays together like "+" on strings. Output should be -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
			// The following uses both concat and slice. Concat is used to glue arrays together, just like the "+" operator does for strings
			function remove(array, index) {
				return array.slice(0, index).concat(array.slice(index + 1)); // Return array sliced from 0 to index, and concat(glue) the array sliced from index + 1 and beyond
				// So it glues like this basically >> array.slice [0 - 3].concat[(3+1) - 5] (using 3 as an example index)
			}
			console.log(remove(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"], 2)); // Pass a table in, remove the letter from index 2, which should be c, output should be -> ["a", "b", "d", "e"]

			// Now lets go over strings and their properties!
			/* We can read properties like length and toUpperCase from strings. But you can't add a new property. Example: */
			var myString = "Fido";
			myString.myProperty = "value";
			console.log(myString.myProperty); // Will return -> undefined
			/* Values of type string, number, and boolean are not objects. Although Javascript won't throw an error if you try to set new properties on them, nothing is actually stored.
				These values are immutable and cannot be changed. But these types have built-in properties. Every string has a number of methods. The most useful are probably slice and
				indexOf which are the same array methods of the same name. */
			console.log("coconuts".slice(4, 7)); // Should return -> nut
			console.log("coconut".indexOf("u")); // Should return -> 5. Works exactly the same as an array.
			// One difference is that a string's indexOf can take a string containing more than one character, like so:
			console.log("one two three".indexOf("ee")); // Should return -> 11
			// Using trim() removes white spaces (newlines, spaces, tabs, etc.) from the start to the end of a string
			console.log("   Okay  \n ".trim()); // Should return -> Okay.
			var testString = "abc";
			console.log(testString.length); // Returns the length of the string. Which is -> 3
			console.log(testString.charAt(0)); // Returns the character at index 0, which is -> a
			console.log(testString[1]); // You can also do it like an array, so this should return -> b

			// Now lets go over the Arguments object
			/* Whenever a function is called, a special variable named arguments is added to the environment in which the function body runs. This variable refers to an object
				that holds all of the arguments passed to the function. Remember that in Javascript, your allowed to pass in more or fewer arguments than the function declares
				itself. The arguments object has a length property which tells us the number of arguments that were passed to the function. It also has a property for each
				argument, named 0, 1, 2, and so on. Its alot like an array, but the only difference is that it doesn't have array methods like slice and indexOf. So its a little
				more difficult to use.

				Lets look at an example
			*/
			function argumentCounter() {
				console.log("You gave me", arguments.length, "arguments."); // Return the number of arguments given to the function
			}
			argumentCounter("1st", "2nd arg", "3rd param", "Sausage param"); // Output should be -> You gave me 4 arguments.
			// Remember the addEntry function? lets make an easier to use version of it!
			function addEntry_2(param) { // Create a function addEntry_2 that takes one argument
				var entry = {schedule: [], status: param }; // Create the object entry, which has an empty schedule property and status indicated by the first argument passed
				for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) // Set i to 1 (to skip over first argument), while i < arguments.length, increment i and perform loop
					entry.schedule.push(arguments[i]); // for the schedule property in entry object, push data from arguments array by the index i
				journal.push(entry); // Push into the journal object, the entry object
			}
			addEntry_2(true, "English", "Calculus", "Discrete Mathematics", "Crying"); // Alot easier to use, and can take any number of arguments!
			console.log(journal); // Output onto console. Very cool, chrome lets you interactively examine the objects within the journal object like a tree diagram!

			// Now lets go over the math object
			/* The math object contains tons of different and important ways for you to use mathematics in your programs. It contains tons of methods to perform operations
				such as sqr, sin, cos, tan, acos, asin, atan, PI, random, and lot more stuff. Lets try it out: */
			function randomPointOnCircle(radius) {
				var angle = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;
				return {x: radius * Math.cos(angle),
						y: radius * Math.sin(angle)};
			}
			console.log(randomPointOnCircle(2)); // Should return a random x, and y coordinate on a circle
			console.log(Math.random()); // the Random method for the math object returns any random number between 0 and 1!
			console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)); // Math.floor rounds down to the nearest whole number, Math.random * 10 returns a digit in the 1 - 10 range
			console.log(Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10)); // Math.ceil rounds up to the nearest whole number
			console.log(Math.round(Math.random() * 10)); // Math.round rounds to the nearest number

			// Now lastly, lets cover the global object
			/* The global scope, the space in which a global variable lived in, can also be approached as an object *(mind blown). Each global variable is present as a property
				of this object. In browsers, the global scope object is stored in the window variable. */
			var myVar = 10;
			console.log("myVar" in window); // Should return true since myVar is indeed in the global scope (window)
			console.log(window.myVar); // Should return -> 10
