			/* The purpose of this program is to create a string that represents an 8x8 grid using newline characters to seperate lines.
				At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. Use the variable size to define the dimensions
				of the board dynamically. It should then form a chessboard like so:

				 # # # # 
				# # # #
				 # # # #
				# # # #
				 # # # #
				# # # #
				 # # # #
				# # # #

				This is actually an interview question that is commonly used to weed out shitty developers! */

			var board = "";
			var black = "#";
			var white = "@";
			var size = 3;

			for (var count = 0; count < size * size; count++) {
				if (count % size == 0) {
					// If divisible by the size variable, add a newline
					board += "\n";
				}
				else if (count % 2 == 0) {
					// Add a black block if divisible by 3
					board += black;
				}
				else {
					// A white block, or "space" if not divisible by 3
					board += white;
				}
			}	

			// Output the chessboard
			console.log(board);

			// Okay so I got really close! I just have to figure out why the final column is not printing out on the chessboard. But thats it!
