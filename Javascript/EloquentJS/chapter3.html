<!--
	So this is the 3rd chapter of Eloquent Javascript I'm going to cover!
	Some chapters have pure information and no examples, so I might not create
	a file for that chapter! Also do the excercises for each chapter!!!

	This section covers functions!

		<script>
			// Lets create a function, notice it is declared inside a variable
			var square = function(x) {
				return x * x;
				// Return the parameter multipled by itself
			}
			// Now output and call the function 
			console.log(square(12)); //Output shoukd be 144

			// Now create a function called makeNoise that takes no arguments/parameters
			var makeNoise = function() {
				console.log("Pling!");
			};
			// Now run the makeNoise function
			makeNoise(); // Should output "Pling!"

			// Now crate a function "power" that takes takes two arguments
			var power = function(base, exponent) {
				var result = 1; 
				for (var count = 0; count < exponent; count++) {
					result *= base;
				}
				return result; // Return the result
			}
			console.log(power(2, 10)); // Should output 1024

			// Now lets go over scopes! Remember when declaring variables inside a function, they only exist within that function!
			var x ="outside";
			var f1 = function() {
				var x = "inside f1";
			};
			
			f1(); // f1 will print the variable inside f1, x which equals "inside f1"
			console.log(x); // x will print outside

			var f2 = function() {
				x = "inside f2";
			};
			f2();
			console.log(x);

			/* Now notice the behavior: Look at the output, and that it didn't print inside f1.

				outside
				inside f2

				Thats because a new variable "x" was declared inside f1, while inside f2 changed the existing
				value of "x" to "inside f2". */

			// Now lets go over declaration notation!
			/* Declaration notation is a slighter shorter way to declare a function that is actually similar to C.
			   Instead of writing it as var square = function... its the typical function square() {} */
			console.log(future());
			function future() {
				return "We STILL have no flying cars.";
			}
			/* Notice that you placed the function below the console.log and it still outputed properly, thats because
				when you write functions in declaration notation, the function is conceptually moved to the top of your code,
				regardless of where you actually declared a function */

			/* Now about nesting in declaration notation, in the latest standard of Javascript you cannot nest declaration
				notated functions in conditionals, only nest in the outermost block of a function. Example:

				function example(){
					function a(){} // << This function is okay and safe to declare
					if (something) {
						function b(){} // << This is very bad, and can lead to unpredictable behavior in your program!
					}
				}
			*/

			// Now lets cover optional arguments
			alert("Hello", "Good Evening", "How are you?");
			/* Javascript is incredibly open when it comes to arguments. alert() only takes one argument, so instead of throwing
				an exception, it simply ignores the other ones. This can be great because you can write functions that take multiple
				types of arguments, which will be the next example */

			function power(base, exponent) { // Declare power function which takes two arguments
				var result = 1; // Set result to 1 to perform exponential calculations to it
				if (exponent == undefined) { // If exponent not defined, perform condition
					exponent = 2; // Manually set the exponent to equal 2
				}
				for (var count = 0; count < exponent; count++) { // Count = 0, if count less than exponent, increment count and perform loop
					result = result * base; // Multiply result by base and set the value to result
				}
				return result; // Return the result
			}
			console.log(power(4)); // Answer should be 16, because if exponent argument missing, its automatically assumed to be 2
			console.log(power(4,3)); // Answer should be 64 since its by the exponent of 3!
			// Okay not sure why the function above is not working properly, fix later so you don't get stuck on it!

			// Now we're going to cover closures, or what happens to local variables when the function call creating them is no longer active
			function wrapValue(n) {
				var localVariable = n;
				return function() { return localVariable; };
			}
			var wrap1 = wrapValue(1);
			var wrap2 = wrapValue(2);
			console.log(wrap1()); // << Should output 1
			console.log(wrap2()); // << Should output 2
			/* This allows you to still access the variables. Even multiple instances of them. This feature of being able to reference a specific
				instance of local variables in an enclosing function is called CLOSURE. A function that "closes over" some local variables is
				called "A CLOSURE". This feature helps you to stop worrying about the lifetime of variables and also allow for some creative use of
				function values. */

			// Now lets go over recursion. I already know what this is, but I'm going to cover it again anyway!
			/* Recursion is when a function calls itself. You can do this, but you have to be careful to not overflow the stack, or you'll get an error */
			function power(base, exponent) { // Declare function called power that takes two arguments
				if (exponent == 0) { // If exponent is 0, then the answer is automatically 1
					return 1; // Return 1
				} else { // Else if exponent something else, perform this condition
					return base * power(base, exponent - 1); // Return base argument * power(base, exponet - 1) [HEAD IS STARTING TO HURT]
				}
			}
			console.log(power(2, 3)); // << Output should be 8
			/* Now recursion is an elegant way of doing things but you have to be careful. A loop is about 10 times faster than the recursion
				version of this function. But the general rule is to not worry about the effeciency of things until your program becomes slow */

			// Now lets cover growing functions
			// This function will get the number of cows and chickens, and print them and pad the number with zeros to equal a length of 3 characters!
			function printFarmInventory(cows, chickens) {
				var cowString = String(cows); // Convert to string to use .length to calculate # of characters
				while (cowString.length < 3) {
					cowString = "0" + cowString; // Add a 0 to the end of cowString, thus increasing its length to end the while loop
				}
				console.log(cowString + " Cows"); // Print the number of cows
				var chickenString = String(chickens);
				while (chickenString.length < 3) {
					chickenString = "0" + chickenString; // Add a 0 to the end of chickenString, thus increasing its length to end the while loop
				}
				console.log(chickenString + " Chickens"); // Print number of chickens
			}
			printFarmInventory(9, 13); // Use the function to print number of cows and chickens << Should print 009 Cows / 013 Chickens
			// Heres another of method of doing the same thing, in a much nicer fashion
			function zeroPad(number, width) {
				var string = String(number);
				while (string.length < width) {
					string = "0" + string;
				}
				return string;
			}
			function printFarmInventory2(cows, chickens, pigs) {
				console.log(zeroPad(cows, 3) + " Cows");
				console.log(zeroPad(chickens, 3) + " Chickens");
				console.log(zeroPad(pigs, 3) + " Pigs");
			}
			printFarmInventory2(7, 16, 3); // A much much cleaner and more modular way of doing things. But it does the same thing
			/* Coming from the author of this book, I'm just going to reiterate something I already know. A useful principle to always
				remember is to not add cleverness unless your absolutely sure your going to need it. It can be tempting to write small
				general "frameworks" for every little bit of functionality, but resist that urge. You won't get any real work done, and
				you'll end up writing a bunch of code that no one will ever use. */


			/* Now before closing out, remember the difference between the two ways to define a function:
			var square = function(){};     and       function square(){};
			Called a function expression		     Called a labeled function

			The one declared inside a variable is to prevent hoisting(being called before being declared) and the other allows
			hoisting, or calling at anytime in the program. So using constructors (covered later) won't work on the function inside
			the variable. So you can use the variable function declarations inside an if statement, while the other can't be.*/
