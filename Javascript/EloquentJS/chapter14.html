		<!-- Now lets go over event objects -->
		<button class="click-me">Click me any way you want</button>

				/* There are some more mouse motion events. Whenever a mouse pointer enters or leaves a node, a "mouseover" or "mouseout" fires. You can use these
				for fade and hover effects. Unfortunately things aren't that simple -_- [come on...] You can't just mouseover then mouseout the effect, because when the
				mouse moves from one node to its children, "mouseout" fires on the parent node, though the mouse did not actually leave the node's parent. To make
				matters worse, these events propagate like other events, and so you will recieve "mouseout" events when the mouse leaves one of the child nodes of the
				node which the handler is registered to. To deal with this, we will use the relatedTarget property of the event objects created for these events. It tells
				us, in the case of "mouseover", what element the pointer was over before and, in the case of "mouseout", what element it is going to. We want to change our
				hover effect only when the relatedTarget is outside of our target node. */
				var hover_para = document.querySelector(".hover-para");
				function isInside(node, target) { // Hey I might be able to use this for collisions...
					for (; node != null; node = node.parentNode) // Don't really understand this for loop...
						if (node == target) return true; // If node equals target, the node is inside the target, and return true
					// isInside function follows the given node's parent links until it either reaches the top of the document, or finds the parent we are looking for

				// [Uh oh starting to lose my grip] it doesn't seem to work on hover off. I'll look up a better way to do this later. Its overly complex I feel

		<!-- Now lets go over scroll events -->
		<style>
			.progress {

		<div class="progress"><div></div></div>
			<script>
				/* This is actually pretty simple! Anytime an element is scrolled, a "scroll" event is fired. This has various uses, such as knowing what the user
				is currently looking at, or showing some indication of progress. The following example draws a progress bar in the top right corner, and updates it
				to fill up as you scroll down! */
				var bar = document.querySelector(".progress div");
				// Add global event listener
				addEventListener("scroll", function() { // Pretty simple, add an eventListener to any scrolling
					var max = document.body.scrollHeight - innerHeight; // Set max to equal body scrollHeight - innerHeight(height of window) so you can't keep scrolling
					var percent = (pageYOffset / max) * 100; // Set percent to equal the scroll position on the Y axis divided by max and multiplying by 100
					bar.style.width = percent + "%"; // Set the width. Remember to append whatever unit your using so it doesn't use em by default.

		<!-- Now lets go over focus events -->

		<p>Age: <input type="text" data-help="Your age"></p>
		<p id="help"></p>
			<script>
				/* When an element gains focus, the browser fires a "focus" event on it. When it loses focus, a "blur" event fires. Unlike other events, these events
				do not propagate, a handler on a parent element is not notified when a child element gains or loses focus. The following example displays a help text
				for the text field that currently has focus: */
				var help = document.querySelector("#help"); // Bind #help element to help
				var fields = document.querySelectorAll("input"); // Bind all input fields to fields
				for (var i = 0; i < fields.length; i++) { // Use a for loop to add event handlers to all input objects

						var text = event.target.getAttribute("data-help"); // Set text to equal the data-help attribute value
						help.textContent = text; // Set the text inside #help using the textContent property to the value of text
					});

						help.textContent = ""; // Set help to have no text when blured
					});
				}
			</script>

		<!-- Now lets go over load events -->
		<!-- We don't actually have to go over any code for this one. When a page finishes loading, the "load" event fires on the window and the document body objects.
		Remember that <script> tags run immediately when encountered. Sometimes this is too soon so using this can help. Elements such as images and script tags that
		load external files also have a "load" event that indicates if a resource was located. Like focus events, load events do not propagate. When a page is closed or
		navigated away from (like clicking on a link to leave the site) a "beforeunload" event fires. The main use of this event is to prevent the user from accidently
		losing work by closing a document. -->

		<!-- Now lets cover the script execution timeline -->
			<script>
			/* There are various things that can cause a script to start executing. Reading a <script> tag, an event firing is another, or even a function. Its important
			to understand that even though events can fire at any time, no two scripts in a single document ever run at the same moment. If a script is already running,
			event handlers and pieces of code scheduled in other ways have to wait their turn. This is the reason a document will freeze when a script runs for a long
			time. The browser cannot react to clicks and other events inside the document because it can't run event handlers until the current script finishes running.

			Although some programming environments do allow multiple threads of execution, and can do this to make a program faster. But when you have multiple actors
			touching the same parts of the system at the same time, thinking about a program becomes an order of magnitude harder. Javascript does this to make your life
			easier. 

			But if you really want to do some time-consuming thing in the background without freezing the page, browsers provide something called web workers. A worker
			is an isolated Javascript environment that runs alongside the main program for a document, and can communicate with it only by sending and receiving messages.
			*/

			/*
			// So lets assume you have a chapter14_squareworker.js file
			var squareWorker = new Worker("chapter14_squareworker.js");
			squareWorker.addEventListener("message", function(event) {

			});
			squareWorker.postMessage(10); // Should output 100
			squareWorker.postMessage(24); // Should output 576
			*/
			</script>

		<!-- Now lets cover setting timers -->
			<script>
				/* The setTimeout function is similar to requestAnimationFrame. It schedules another function to be called later. But instead of calling it at the
				next redraw, it waits a given amount of milliseconds. This page turns from white to blue after 10 seconds */
				document.body.style.background = "white"
				setTimeout(function() {
					document.body.style.background = "lightblue";
				}, 10000);

				var bombTimer = setTimeout(function() { // Set a timer that will call a function in 500 milliseconds
					console.log("BOOM!"); // Output BOOM when 500 milliseconds passes
				}, 500);

					console.log("Defused."); // Output defused
					clearTimeout(bombTimer); // Cancel the BombTimer timer
				}

				/* The cancelAnimation frame along with requestAnimationFrame works in the same way as setTimout and clearTimout in that it will cancel the frame (if it
				hasn't already been called). A similar set of functions, setInterval and clearInterval are used to set timers that should repeat every X milliseconds
				(EXTREMELY USEFUL) */
				var ticks = 0; // Create a variable ticks and set to 0
				var clock = setInterval(function() { // Set clock to equal to setInterval()
					console.log("tick", ticks++); // Output tick and increment ticks (didn't know you can increment values inside console.log())

		<!-- Now lets cover debouncing -->
		<textarea>Type something here...</textarea>
			<script>
			/* Some events have the potential to fire rapidly, many times in a row (like mousemove and scroll). When handling such events, you must be careful not to
			do anything too time-consuming or your handler will take up so much time that interaction with the document starts to feel slow and choppy. If you do
			need to do something nontrivial with such a handler, use setTimeout to make sure you are not doing it too often. This is called debouncing the event. */
			*/
				var textarea = document.querySelector("textarea"); // Bind textarea to the textarea tag above
				var timeout; // Create an empty variable "timeout"
				textarea.addEventListener("keydown", function() { // Add an event listener for whenever a keydown event fires inside textarea
