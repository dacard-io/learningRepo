<!--
	So this is the 2nd chapter of Eloquent Javascript I'm going to cover!
	Some chapters have pure information and no examples, so I might not create
	a file for that chapter! Also do the excercises for each chapter!!!

		<script>
			// Declare some variables
			var caught = 5 * 5;
			var ten = 10;
			/* As a quick note, variables cannot be named reserved words, cannot
			   have spaces and cannot start with a number */

			// Print out some values onto the JS console!
			console.log(caught);
			console.log(ten * ten);

			// Set a variable to a string
			var mood = "light";
			console.log(mood); // Then output the mood variable
			var mood = "dark"; // Change the variable to another value
			console.log(mood); // Output the mood variable again to show a different value

			// Do some calculations on a variable
			var DavidsDebt = 3800;
			// Perform an operation onto the variables value
			DavidsDebt = DavidsDebt - 1400;
			// Now output the new value
			console.log(DavidsDebt);

			// Now declare variables on the same line
			var one = 1, two = 2;
			console.log(one + two); // Now output the two variables combined

			// Now use the alert function
			alert("Hello again!");

			// Now declare a variable, and print a string a variable at the same time
			var x = 78;
			console.log("the value of x is", x);

			// Now use the Math.max function to get the highest value of two values
			console.log(Math.max(2, 4)); // Output should be 4

			// Now create a confirmation box!
			confirm("Shall we?");
			// Now create a prompt! The second argument is the default value shown
			prompt("Tell me what you know.", "...")
			/* As a note, its not recommended to use alert, confirm, and prompt boxes
			   in modern web design because of the inability to style the way they look */

			/* So now I'm going to cover conditionals. Big note, you can actually
				leave out the curly braces {} in conditionals. But it looks inconsistent
				and can be difficult to manage. For the rest of the tutorials, I'm going 
				to use curly braces. But I would like to show how you don't have to use it
				here!
			*/

			// Now create a basic conditional program
			var theNumber = Number(prompt("Pick a number", "")); // Use Number() to convert argument given into a number
			// If the variable is a number, output the variable through an alert box
			if (!isNaN(theNumber))
				alert("Your number is the square root of " + theNumber * theNumber);
			else
				alert("ERROR - You didn't give a number");

			// Now do a more complete if conditional
			var num = Number(prompt("Pick a number", "0"))
			if (num < 10)
				alert("Small Number!");
			else if (num < 100)
				alert("Medium Number!");
			else
				alert("Come on man, you have to give a number");

			// Now perform a while loop
			var number = 0;
			while (number <= 12) {
				console.log(number);
				number = number + 2;
				// Works exactly like a for loop, while number less than or equal to 12,
				// output the variable, and increment it's value by 2. So it should output
				// its value 7 times!
			}

			// Now perform a do...while loop! 
			/* Remember the difference between a while and do...while loop... the do...while loop executes at least one time before running the conditional */
			do { // Run the loop one time first
				var yourName = prompt("What is your name?") // Ask for a name, and store in yourName variable
			} while (!yourName); // Prompt the user until it returns a non-empty string
			console.log(yourName); // Output the variable

			/* Lets go over the condition above real quick. When you apply the NOT operator (!) to a string, all strings except " " return true */

			// Now create a for loop
			// Syntax: for (init variable, condition to run, and increment)
			for (var number = 0; number <= 12; number = number + 2) {
				console.log(number);
			} // Exactly the same as the while loop from before!

			// Now how to break out of a loop, use the break statement!
			/* Notice how this for loop doesn't have a conditional, this means it will run forever until a break is initiated */
			// Also look at how the incrementing is the same as C!
			for (var current = 20; ; current++) {
				if (current % 7 == 0) { // If "current" is divisible by 7, then return 0, and validate the condition
					break; // Break the loop!
				}
			}
			// At first, current won't be divisible by 7, but it will iterate until it reaches a value divisible by 7, which would be 21 in this case!
			console.log(current); // Output the variable, which should be 21!

			/* Now update variables in C style. I'm not actually going to place the code in, but it will show the different styles:
				counter = counter + 1;
				counter += 1; << Does the same thing above, but shorthamded
				counter = counter - 1;
				counter -= 1;
				counter++, counter-- << Increment or decrement by 1 */

			// Now lastly, perform a switch case. You know the way it works already. Javascript is extremely similar to C/C++
			switch(prompt("How is the weather? (lowercase only)")) {
				case "rainy":
					console.log("Bring an umbrella");
					// Don't forget to break each case!
					break;
				case "sunny":
					console.log("Dress lightly");
					/* Notice theres no break here! Thats to share code between two cases. In this case,
					   it will recommend dressing lightly and going outside */
				case "cloudy":
					console.log("Go outside!");
					break;
				default:
					console.log("Unknown weather type!");
					break;
