			// Lets use the reduce method in combination with the "concat" method to flatten an array of arrays into a single array that has all the elements of the
			// input arrays

			var arrays = [[1,2,3], [4,5], [6]];
			// Now code goes below. Goal is to produce output -> [1,2,3,4,5,6]

			function reduce(array, combine, start) { // Create a function called "reduce" that takes three arguments
				var current = start; // Create a variable "current" and set it to equal the third argument "start"
				for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { // Set i to 0, while i less than array.length, increment i and perform loop
					current = combine(current, array[i]); // Rewrite current's value to create a combine function that takes two parameters
				}
				return current; // Return the evaluation
			}
			/* Okay the solution is below (not by me unfortunately). I feel kinda bad but this chapter was a little too difficult for me. It encapsulated functions inside functions and used functions as arguments for other functions. It was a little much for me. I'll come back to this chapter, I would definitely like to understand
			it better later on */
