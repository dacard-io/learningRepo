			/* Lets quickly go over HTTP methods, and basic info. When you type the URL of a website or document
			in your browser, it tries to open a TCP connection on port 80 (which is the default port for HTTP
			traffic). If the server exists and accepts a connction, the browser sends something like this:

				GET /17_http.html HTTP/1.1
				Host: eloquentjavascript.net
				User-Agent: Your browser's name

				// Then the server responds through that same connection...

				HTTP/1.1 200 OK
				Content-Length: 65585
				Content-Type: text/html
				Last-Modified: Wed, 09 Apr 2014 10:48:09 GMT

				<!doctype html>
				...rest of document

			The information sent by the client is called a request, and is the first line "GET /17...".
			"GET" is the method of the request. Get means that we want to get the specified source. Other
			common methods are DELETE to delete a resource, PUT to replace it, and POST to send information
			to it. Remember, the server is not obliged to carry out every request.

			Then it will start with a version of the HTTP protocol "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" followed by a three-digit
			status code. Status codes that begin with a 2 indicate a successful operation, Codes starting with a
			4 indicate something went wrong with the request (404 for example indicates the file was not found).
			An error code beginning with 5 means an error occured on the server, and the request is not to blame.

			Then afterwards, information about the document is passed such as the size of the HTML document as 
			"Content-Length" in bytes, when it was last modified, type, etc.

		<!-- Now lets create a form to dissect the HTTP request -->
		<form method="GET" action="chapter17.html">
			<p>Name: <input type="text" name="name"></p>
			<p>Message:<br><textarea name="message"></textarea></p>
			<p><button type="submit">Send</button></p>
		</form>
		<!-- So now lets dissect the request and how it was made. You created a form that sends a GET request
			to the chapter17.html file, which is the current page. The code then associates with the form
			two input fields (a regular input field, and a text area), gives them a name for the request, etc.
			Then when you click the send button, the information is then encoded into a query string. That query
			string is tacked onto the action URL, and the browser makes a GET request to that URL.

			GET ..(filelocation)/chapter17.html?name=David+Cardoso&message=Hello

			You can actually see the method being passed along the URL! The form data is easily passed through.
			But of course lets further dissect it. The start of a query string is indicated by a question mark.
			After that, the corresponding attributes are added along with their values, and seperated by an
			ampersand (&).

			/* Everything has a format, and URL encoding is no different. It uses % symbols for escape 
			sequences, etc. You can do this easily in Javascript */
			console.log(encodeURIComponent("Hello & Goodbye")); // Output -> Hello%20%26%20goodbye
			console.log(decodeURIComponent("Hello%20%26%20goodbye")); // Output -> Hello & goodbye

			/* More about the different HTTP methods. By convention, the GET method is used for requests that do
			not have side effects to the server, such as doing a search. Requests that change something on the server such as creating a new account or posting a message, you should use POST. */

			// Now lets cover XMLHTTPRequest, and making a request to some data
			/* XMLHTTPRequest, is used to parse response documents as XML. It can do things such as show a list
			of results calculated while the user is still typing in the search without reloading the page. So
			lets make a simple request, by creating a request object with XMLHttpRequest constructor and call
			its open and send methods: */
			var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); // Create an XMLHttpRequest object
			req.open("GET", "chapter17_xmlData.txt", false); 
			/* Use the open method on req object, using the GET HTTP method on the text file "chapter17_xmlData.txt", and the last argument is async. So if its false, it will only perform more HTTP operations when the open request is completed */
			req.send(null); // Then after opening the request, we send it with the "send" method. For GET requests, we can use null.
			console.log(req.responseText); // Then send the reponse text recieved
			console.log(req.status, req.statusText); // Output -> 200 OK
			console.log(req.getResponseHeader("content-type")); // Output -> text/plain
			/* Your going to get errors on XMLHttpRequest because your trying to pull XML data from a file:// and not using an actual
			HTTP server so there you can't make HTTP requests. But I'm typing up everything anyway

			// Now lets cover asynchronous requests */
			/* From the last section, you noticed that the open method for an XMLHttpRequest object has a third argument that is boolean
			that indicates whether the request is asynchronous. If its set to be asynchronous, that means that when we call send, the only
			thing that happens right away is that the request is scheduled to be sent. Our program can continue and the browser will
			take care of sending and recieving data in the background. But as long as the request is running, we won't be able to access
			the response. We need a mechanism that will notify us when the data us available, by listening to a "load" event. */
			var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); // Create an XMLHttpRequest object
			req.open("GET", "chapter17_xmlData.txt", true); // Open a request to get data from the chapter17_xmlData.txt asyncronously
			req.addEventListener("load", function() { // When the request is completed or "loads" perform event
				console.log("Done:", req.status);	// Output -> Done: 200
			});
			req.send(null); // Send the reponse

			// Now lets go over fetching XML data
			/* When the resource is retrieved by an XMLHttpRequest object is an XML document, the object's responseXML property will
			hold a parsed representation of the document. The object that responsiveXML document property holds corresponds to the document
			object. Its documentElement property refers to the outer tag of the XML document. The XML data for fruits is layed out as such:

			<fruits>
				<fruit name="banana" color="yellow"/>
				<fruit name="lemon" color="yellow"/>
				<fruit name="cherry" color="red"/>
			</fruits>

			We can retrieve it like this: */
			var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
			req.open("GET", "chapter17_xmlData.xml", false);
			req.send(null);
			console.log(req.responseXML.querySelectorAll("fruit").length); // Should output -> 3
			//But its often a better idea to communicate using JSON data
			var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
			req.open("GET", "chapter17_xmlData.json", false);
			req.send(null);
			console.log(JSON.parse(req.responseText)); // Output -> {banana: "yellow", lemon: "yellow", cherry: "red"}

			// Now lets go over abstracting a request
			function backgroundReadFile(url, callback) {
				var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
				req.open("GET", url, true);
				req.addEventListener("load", function() {
					if (req.status < 400)
						callback(req.responseText);
				});
				req.send(null);
			}

			function getURL(url, callback) {
				var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
				req.open("GET", url, true);
				req.addEventListener("load", function() {
					if (req.status < 400)
						callback(req.responseText);
					else
						callback(null, new Error("Request failed: " + req.statusText));
				});
				req.addEventListener("error", function() {
					callback(null, new Error("Network error"))
				});
				req.send(null);
			}
			getURL("data.nonsense.txt", function(content, error) {
				if (error != null)
					console.log("Failed to detch nonsense.txt: " + error);
				else
					console.log("nonsense.txt: " + content);
			});
