			// So lets cover abstractions
			/* Abstractions are exactly what you think they are. They "abstract" details and give us the ability to talk about problems
				at a higher (or more abstract level). Lets look at the example: */
			var array = [1, 2, 3]; // Create an array
			for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { // Set i to 0, while i less than number of array elements, increment i and perform loop
				var current = array[i]; // Set current to equal the element at array index i
				console.log(current); // Output the variable current
			}
			// But why does it have to be a for statement with a variable declaration. Lets abstract it with a function!
			function logEach(array) {
				for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
					console.log(array[i]);
				}
			} // and boom! thats what abstraction is. Don't let fancy programming terminology scare you

			// Now lets cover higher-order functions
			/* High-order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or returning them. If you
				didn't notice, functions are basically regular values. Yes they do calculate something, but they return a value. So using them in
				a function shouldn't be a problem. High-order functions can help to abstract over actions, not just values */
			
			// Heres a function that creates a function
			function greaterThan(n) { // greaterThan takes one argument
				return function(m) { // Return value of function with argument (m). Argument m is passed only when n is already passed.
					return m > n; // Return the evaluation of whether m is greater than m. If so, return true
				}
			}
			var greaterThan10 = greaterThan(10); // Predetermine argument n - a very strange concept to me
			console.log(greaterThan10(11)); // Since argument n is aleady passed, the other argument passed should be m. Should output -> true

			// Heres a function that provides new types of control flow in a program
			function unless(test, then) {
				if (!test) then();
			}
			function repeat(times, body) {
				for (var i = 0; i < times; i++) {
					body(i);
				}
			}
			repeat(3, function(n) {
				unless(n % 2, function() {
					console.log(n, "is even");
				});
			}); // Output -> 0 is even, 2 is even (*MIND BLOWN)

			// Now lets cover passing along arguments
			/* Observe a function defined earlier */
			function noisy(f) {
				return function(arg) {
					console.log("calling with", arg);
					var val = f(arg);
					console.log("called with", arg, "- got", val);
					return val;
				};
			}
			/* This function has a big problem. If f takes more than one parameter, it gets only the first one. It would also deprive us of information from arguments.length.

			For these situations, Javascript has an apply method that can pass as an array-like object. Take a look: */
			function transparantWrapping(f) {
				return function() {
					return f.apply(null, arguments);
				}
			}
			/* Its a useless function but its construct can be applied in a variety of situations. The function it returns passes all of the given arguments, to argument "f". Extremely useful. It does this by passing its own arguments object to apply. The first argument to apply, for which we are passing null, can be used to simulate a method call. Well use apply more in the next chapter. */

			// Now lets cover JSON (thank god)
			/* JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation and is simply a format in which data can be read. APIs use this format, and you can manipulate JSON data in many different ways. JSON data can be saved into an actual *.json file! lets go over basic usage.*/
			
			// We are going to include it as an actual JSON file! You can take a look at the way data is formatted in the other file. Now lets work with JSON!
			var string = JSON.stringify({name: "X", born: 1980});
			console.log(string); // Output should be -> {"name":"X","born":1980}
			console.log(JSON.parse(string).born); // Output should be -> 1980
			/* Okay so the way this works, is that we aren't exactly using the JSON file just yet. We're showing how JSON data is passed through. You can see that
			JSON.stringify takes the values given and returns an encoded string. JSON.parse then takes the string and converts it to the value it encodes. You can see
			that just like an object, you can pull the property out of the JSON data. Now lets actually use the JSON file this time! */

			var ancenstry = JSON.parse(ANCESTRY_FILE); // No need to stringify since the JSON data already has been stringified!
			console.log(ancenstry.length) // Should output the amount of objects found in the JSON file, which is -> 39

			// Now lets cover filtering an array (Another construct!)
			function filter(array, test) { // Create a function filter that passes two arguments
				var passed = []; // Create an empty array called "passed"
				for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { // Set i to equal 0, while i less than array.length, increment i and perform loop

				return person.father == "Carel Haverbeke";			//  Should return an object with the object that has "Carel" as the father property
			}));

			// Now lets cover transforming with map
			/* Lets say we have an array of objects representing people, produced by filtering the ancestry array somehow. But we want an array of names which
			is alot easier to read. The "map" method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned
			values. The new array will have the same length as the input array, but its conent will have been "mapped" to a new form by the function */
			function map(array, transform) { // So create a function called "map" that takes two arguments

				for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { // Set i to 0, while i less than array.length, increment i and perform loop

			});
			console.log(map(overNinety, function(person) {
				return person.name;
			})); // Output should return an array of search results. -> ["Clara Aernoudts", "Emile Haverbeke", "Maria Haverbeke"]

			// Now lets cover using a reduce function
			/* Another method we are going to be looking at is getting several arrays and computing a single value from them. */

			function reduce(array, combine, start) { // Create a function called "reduce" that takes three arguments
				var current = start; // Create a variable "current" and set it to equal the third argument "start"
				for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { // Set i to 0, while i less than array.length, increment i and perform loop

			}

			console.log(reduce([1, 2, 3, 4], function(a, b) { // So use the reduce function by passing in the array [1,2,3,4], then create the combine function
				return a + b; // Return a a + b
			}, 0)); // Output should be -> 10

			// We can use reduce to find the most ancient known ancestor
			console.log(ancenstry.reduce(function(min, cur) { // SO take the ancestry JSON data, and reduce with the function that takes two arguments
				if (cur.born < min.born) return cur;
				else return min; // Else that means the current object is the oldest ancestor, and return
			})); // Should output an object with "name" "Pauwels van Haverbeke" born in 1535

			// Lets go over composability
			// Now lets actually write the previous example without high-order functions to see what it would normally look like
			var min = ancenstry[0]; // Set min to equal the first element of the ancestry JSON data
			for (var i = 1; i < ancenstry.length; i++) { // Set i to equal 1, if i is less than the amount of objects in the ancestry array, increment i and loop

					min = cur; // Set min to equal cur
			} 
			console.log(min); // Should output an object with "name" "Pauwels van Haverbeke" born in 1535
			/* To be honest that was alot easier, but this chapter is about using functions to help perform calculations, so its good to go over all the kinds
			of different methods you can use to simplify tasks. Although there are a few more variables and the program is longer, it is alot easier to understand.
			High-order functions really show their utility when you need to "compose" functions. Here an example, lets write some code that finds the average age for
			men and women in the dat set. */
			
			function average(array) { // Create a function "average" that takes an one argument
				function plus(a, b) { return a + b; } // Create a function inside average called "plus" that takes two arguments, and adds them together (...why?)
				return array.reduce(plus) / array.length; // Return array.reduce(plus) divided by the number of objects passed throygh the array argument
			}
			function age(p) { return p.died - p.born; }
			function male(p) { return p.sex == "m"; }
			function female(p) { return p.sex == "m"; }

			console.log(average(ancenstry.filter(male).map(age))); // Output should be -> 61.67
			console.log(average(ancenstry.filter(female).map(age))); // Output should be -> 54.56

			/* Now your starting to see why high-order functions are great to implement. Look at how clean and easy to understand that code is. No not the function aspect
			   of it, but the actual way you type it. No iterative loops or anything. Although the "plus" function seems a bit silly. But there is a cost to using
			   this kind of coding... */

			/* Although high-order functions are awesome and can make code incredibly readable, declaring all these functions and intermediate arrays/arrays inside functions
			etc. are costly to the applications performance. Remember, if you see a slow down in your code, it might be that there is an inner loop inside of a loop. 
			Code cautiously. */

			// Now lets go over binding
			/* The bind method (which all functions have), creates a new function that will call the original function but with some of the arguments already fixed.
			The following code shows an example of bind in use. It defines a function isInSet that tells us whether a person is in a given set of strings. To call filter
			in order to collect those person objects whose names are in a specific set.
			*/
			var theSet = ["Carek Haverbeke", "Maria van Brussel", "Donald Duck"];
			function isInSet(set, person) {
				return set.indexOf(person.name) > -1;
			}

			console.log(ancenstry.filter(function(person) {
				return isInSet(theSet, person);
			})); // Should output -> [{name: "Maria van Brussel", ...}, {name: "Carel Haverbeke", ...}]
			console.log(ancenstry.filter(isInSet.bind(null, theSet))); // Should output the same result
			/* The call to bind returns a function that will call isInSet with theSet as the first argument, followed by any remaining arguments given to the
			bound function. The first argument null, is used for method calls, similar to the first argument to apply. Will go over more of this in the next chapter */
