			/* Purpose of this exercise is to design an "interface" that extrudes the range of values from an array */

			// Create the logFive function which iterates through a sequence of objects and calls console.log on its first five elements
			function logFive(object) {
				if (object.to < 5)
					for (var i = object.from; i <= object.to; i++)
						console.log(i);
				else
					for (var i = object.from; i < object.from + 5; i++)
						console.log(i);
			}
			
			// Create a constructor called ArraySeq
			function ArraySeq(array) {
				this.from = array[0];
				this.to = array[1];
			}

			logFive(new ArraySeq([1, 2])); // Output should be -> 1\n 2\n 3...and so on to five
			logFive(new ArraySeq([100, 1000])); // Output should be -> 1\n 2\n 3...and so on to five

			/* Okay so I implemented a solution that was completely different from what the book wanted, but I'm sorry it works
			exactly as intended and I don't know how to implement the correct solution */
