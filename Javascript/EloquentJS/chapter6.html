<!--
	Okay so the last chapter got too complex for me but I will come back to it later. I think this chapter will be much easier to understand. It covers
	all the different things you do with objects, including inheritance, polymorphism, etc.

	This section covers a more in-depth look at objects!

			// Keep in mind you may relearn some parts you already know in this chapter, but do them anyways for the sake of memorization

			// Lets cover methods
			/* Methods are simply properties that hold function values. Here is a simple example of one */
			var rabbit = {}; // Create an empty object called "rabbit"
			rabbit.speak = function(line) { // Create a property for "rabbit" that acts as a function
				console.log("The rabbit says '" + line + "'");
			}
			rabbit.speak("I'm alive."); // Output should be "I'm alive"
			/* Okay, now this is extremely useful. Maybe when creating a game or something, you can create an object "player" and one of it's methods
			can have it perform an action, like for example -> player.move("left") [Oh shit thats sick as hell] */
			// Lets keep it going with some more objects
			function speak(line) { // Create a function speak that takes one argument "line"
				console.log("The " + this.type + " rabbit says '" + line + "'"); // Use "this" for the contextual objects data
			}
			var whiteRabbit = {type: "white", speak: speak}; // Give the whiteRabbit object a property with the speak function
			var fatRabbit = {type: "fat", speak: speak}; // Give the fatRabbit object a property with the speak function
			whiteRabbit.speak("I'm a rabbit and my fur is white and soft!");
			fatRabbit.speak("I haven't made responsible dieting decisions in the past few years of my life");
			// Now do the same thing but with apply and call methods
			speak.apply(fatRabbit, ["Burp!"]); // Should output -> The fat rabbit says 'Burp!'
			speak.call({type: "old"}, "Oh my.") // Should output -> The old rabbit says 'Oh my.'
			/* These are interesting because they take regular arguments. Notice the call method doesn't actually need a new object */

			// Now lets cover Prototypes!
			/* First before we cover prototypes, lets do an example to better understand the explanation */
			var empty = {};
			console.log(empty.toString); // Output -> function toString(){...}
			console.log(empty.toString()); // Output -> [object Object]
			/* You just pulled a property out of an empty object! Well not exactly all that happened was information was withheld. All objects have a set of properties,
			and in addition almost all projects have a prototype. A prototype is another object that is used as a fallback source of properties. When an object gets a
			request for a property that it does not have, it's prototype will be searched for the peoperty, then the prototype's protoype, and so on. So what's the prototype
			of an empty object? the entity behind almost all objects, Object.ptototype */
			console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf({}) == Object.prototype); //  Should output -> true
			console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype)); // Output -> null
			/* The getPrototypeOf function obviously returns the prototype of an object. Some objects don't directly have Object.prototype as their prototype, but instead
			have another object, which provides its own default properties. Functions derive from Function.protoype, and arrays derive from Array.prototype*/

			/* The Object.getPrototypeOf function returns the prototype of an object. We can use Object.create to create an object with a specific prototype. */
			var protoRabbit = { // Create an object called protoRabbit with a speak property that performs a function
				speak: function(line) {
					console.log("The " + this.type + " rabbit says '" + line + "'");
				}
			};
			var killerRabbit = Object.create(protoRabbit); // Okay thats pretty cool, we let killerRabbit take on properties from protoRabbit to be used
			killerRabbit.type = "killer"; // Create a property "type" and set it to killer for killerRabbit object
			killerRabbit.speak("SKREEE!"); // Output -> The killer rabit says 'SKREEE!'

			// Now lets go over constructors
			/* A more convenient way to derive an object from a shared prototype is to use a constructor. In Javascript, calling a function with the new keyword in
			front of it causes it to be treated as a constructor. The constructor will have its "this" variable bound to a fresh object, and unless it explicitely
			returns another object value, this new object will be returned from the call. Lets go over a simple constructor for rabbits. Use the convention to
			capitalize the names of constructors so they are easily distinguished from other functions */
			function Rabbit(type) {
				this.type = type;
			}

			var killerRabbit = new Rabbit("killer");
			var blackRabbit = new Rabbit("black");
			console.log(blackRabbit.type); // Output -> black

			/* Constructors (and all functions) automatically get a property named prototype, which by default holds a plain, empty object that derives from
			Object.prototype. Every instance created with this constructor will have this object as its prototype. So to add a speak method to rabbits created with
			the Rabbit constructor, we can simply do this: */
			Rabbit.prototype.speak = function(line) {
				console.log("The " + this.type + " rabbit says '" + line + "'");
			};
			blackRabbit.speak("Doom..."); // Output -> The black rabbit says 'Doom...'

			// Now lets go over overriding derived properties
			/* When you add a property to an object, whether it is present in the learning prototype or not, the property is added to the object itself. If there is
			a property by the same name in the prototype, this property will no longer affect the object. The prototype itself is is not changed. */
			Rabbit.prototype.teeth = "small";
			console.log(killerRabbit.teeth); // Output -> small
			killerRabbit.teeth = "long, sharp, and bloody";
			console.log(killerRabbit.teeth); // Output -> long sharp and bloody
			console.log(blackRabbit.teeth); // Output -> small
			/* This is really good to know. The object will have its own property over the prototype, regardless of whether or not the name is the same, and for any
			other objects, the prototype's propertys do not change. */

			// Calling toString on an array gives a result similar to .join on it - it puts commas between the values in the array
			console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call([1, 2])); // Output -> [object Array]
			/* Directly calling Object.prototype.toString with an array produces a different string. That function doesn't know about arrays, so it simply puts puts the
			word "object" and the name of the type between the square brackets. */

			// Now lets go over prototype interference
			/* A prototype can be used at any time to add new properties and methods to all objects based on it. But sometimes issues can arise. In the previous chapters
			we used an object as a way to associate values with names by creating properties for the names and giving them the corresponding value as their value.
			Heres the example from Chapter 4: */
			var map = {};
			function storePhi(event, phi) {
				map[event] = phi;
			}
			storePhi("pizza", 0.069);
			storePhi("touched tree", -0.081);

			Object.prototype.nonsense = "hi";
			for (var name in map) {
				console.log(name);
			} // Output -> pizza \n touched tree \n nonsense
			console.log("nonsense" in map); // output -> true
			console.log("toString" in map); // output -> true
			delete Object.prototype.nonsense; // Delete the "nonsense" property from the default object prototype
			/* See the strange behavior? There is no event called "nonsense" in our dataset. And there is no event called "toString", but oddly toString did show up
			as true in the "in" operator but not the for loop. That is because Javascript distinguishes between enumerable and nonenumerable properties. Enumerable
			properties that we create by simply assigning them. Nonenumerable properties are all the standard properties in Object.prototype, why is why they won't
			show up in such a for/in loop. [...thats odd but okay] Its possible to define your own nonenumerable properties by using the Object.defineProperty function,
			which allows us to control the type of property we are creating */
			Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, "hiddenNonsense", {
				enumerable: false, value: "hi"
			});
			// Now we try the loop again and it should work
			for (var name in map) {
				console.log(name);
			} // Output -> pizza \n touched tree
			console.log(map.hiddenNonsense); // output -> hi

			console.log(map.hasOwnProperty("toString")); // output -> false
			/* the hasOwnProperty method tells us whether the object itself has the property, without looking at its prototypes. This can be more useful than "in". */

			// Now lets go over Prototype-less objects
			/* Sometimes prototypes get in the way and sometimes it would be better to use an object without any prototypes. You can use create(null) to do this */
			var map = Object.create(null); // Create the prototype-less object
			map["pizza"] = 0.069;
			console.log("toString" in map); // Output -> false - See now we don't need to use hasOwnProperty because all the properties are in the object
			console.log("pizza" in map) // output -> true

			// Now lets cover Polymorphism
			/* When you call the String function (which converts a value to a string on an object), it will call the toString method on that object to try and create
			a meaningful string to return. This is the basis of polymorphism. When a piece of code is written to work with objects that have a certain interface.
			Polymorphic code can work with values of different shapes, as long as they the suppoert the interface it expects.

			So with that being said, lets build a table with a "name" column, a "height" column, and a "country" column for mountains. The interface will consist of a
			minHeight function which returns a number indicating the minimum height this cell requires (in lines); minWidth() returns a number indicating this cell's
			minimum width (in characters); draw(width, height) returns an array of length "height", which contains a series of strings that are each "width" characters
			wide (this will represent the content of the cell) */
			// This is a rather long example, but its an example of an interface so just get through it 
			
			function rowHeights(rows) {
				return rows.map(function(row) {
					return row.reduce(function(max, cell) {
						return Math.max(max, cell.minHeight());
					}, 0);
				});
			}

			function colWidths(rows) {
				return rows[0].map(function(_, i) { // Using an argument _ indicates that the first argument will not be read
					return rows.reduce(function(max, row) {
						return Math.max(max, row[i].minWidth());
					}, 0);
				});
			}
			function drawTable(rows) {
				var heights = rowHeights(rows);
				var widths = colWidths(rows);

				function drawLine(blocks, lineNo) {
					return blocks.map(function(block) {
						return block[lineNo];
					}).join(" ");
				}
				function drawRow(row, rowNum) {
					var blocks = row.map(function(cell, colNum) {
						return cell.draw(widths[colNum], heights[rowNum]);
					});
					return blocks[0].map(function(_, lineNo) {
						return drawLine(blocks, lineNo);
					}).join("\n");
				}
				return rows.map(drawRow).join("\n");
			}
			function repeat(string, times) {
				var result = "";
				for (var i = 0; i < times; i++) {
					result += string;
				}
				return result;
			}
			function TextCell(text) {
				this.text = text.split("\n");
			}
			TextCell.prototype.minWidth = function() {
				return this.text.reduce(function(width, line) {
					return Math.max(width, line.length);
				}, 0);
			};
			TextCell.prototype.minHeight = function() {
				return this.text.length;
			};
			TextCell.prototype.draw = function(width, height) {
				var result = [];
				for (var i = 0; i < height; i++) {
					var line = this.text[i] || "";
					result.push(line + repeat(" ", width - line.length));
				}
				return result;
			}
			function UnderlinedCell(inner) {
				this.inner = inner;
			}
			UnderlinedCell.prototype.minWidth = function() {
				return this.inner.minWidth();
			};
			UnderlinedCell.prototype.minHeight = function() {
				return this.inner.minWidth() + 1;
			};
			UnderlinedCell.prototype.draw = function(width, height) {
				return this.inner.draw(width, height -1).concat([repeat("-", width)]);
			};
			function dataTable(data) {
				var keys = Object.keys(data[0]);
				var headers = keys.map(function(name) {
					return new UnderlinedCell(new TextCell(name));
				});
				var body = data.map(function(row) {
					return keys.map(function(name) {
						return new TextCell(String(row[name]));
					});
				});
				return [headers].concat(body);
			}
			// Now the underlying mechanism that controls the table is complete 
			var MOUNTAINS = [
			  {name: "Kilimanjaro", height: 5895, country: "Tanzania"},
			  {name: "Everest", height: 8848, country: "Nepal"},
			  {name: "Mount Fuji", height: 3776, country: "Japan"},
			  {name: "Mont Blanc", height: 4808, country: "Italy/France"},
			  {name: "Vaalserberg", height: 323, country: "Netherlands"},
			  {name: "Denali", height: 6168, country: "United States"},
			  {name: "Popocatepetl", height: 5465, country: "Mexico"}
			];

			console.log(drawTable(dataTable(MOUNTAINS))); // Look at how good that implementation is. One. Line. Just one. Its beautiful.

			// Lets cover getters and setters
			/* Javascript provides a technique that gets us the best of both worlds in terms of properties that are not methods. We can specify properties that,
			from the outside, look like normal properties but secretly have methods associated with them. */
			var pile = { // Create an object called "pile"
				elements: ["eggshell", "orange peel", "worm"],
				get height() {
					return this.elements.length;
				},
				set height(value) {
					console.log("Ignoring attempt to set height to", value);
				}
				// Use a set property to pass a setter method. When a getter but no setter is defined, writing to the property is ignored
			};
			/* Get or set notation for properties allows you to specify a function to be run when the property is read or written */
			console.log(pile.height); // Output -> 3
			pile.height = 100; // Ignores attempt to set height to 100

			// Now lets cover inheritance
			/* Basically all inheritance is is when using a new constructor, you can create a new object but use the same properties as another object.
			Take a look at how it works */
			function RTextCell(text) {
				TextCell.call(this, text);
			}
			RTextCell.prototype = Object.create(TextCell.prototype); // Let RTextCell's prototype equal TextCell's to inherit its values
			RTextCell.prototype.draw = function(width, height) {
				var result = [];
				for (var i = 0; i < height; i++) {
					var line = this.text[i] || "";
					result.push(repeat(" ", width - line.length) + line);
				}
				return result;
			}

			// Now lets cover the InstanceOf operator
			/* Sometimes it can be useful to know whether an object was derived from a specific construcor. You can use the binary operator called InstanceOf for this */
			console.log(new RTextCell("A") InstanceOf RTextCell); // Output -> true
			console.log(new RTextCell("A") InstanceOf TextCell); // Output -> true
			console.log(new TextCell("A") InstanceOf RTextCell); // Output -> false
			console.log([1] InstanceOf Array); // Output -> true
