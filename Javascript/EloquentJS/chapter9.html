<!--
	This section covers more about regular expressions and calculations!
	Regular expressions are a way to describe patterns in string data! So
	this is pretty major!

	Regular expressions can actually be used to for example replace all newline characters
	pretty easily in a string, or parse data from a file, etc. This section will help make
	sense of alot of things, even though its kinda boring!

		<!-- /* Now to conclude this chapter, here is a quick overview of regular expression syntax:

			
			/abc/	A sequence of characters
			/[abc]/	Any character from a set of characters
			/[^abc]/	Any character not in a set of characters
			/[0-9]/	Any character in a range of characters
			/x+/	One or more occurrences of the pattern x
			/x+?/	One or more occurrences, nongreedy
			/x*/	Zero or more occurrences
			/x?/	Zero or one occurrence
			/x{2,4}/	Between two and four occurrences
			/(abc)/	A group
			/a|b|c/	Any one of several patterns
			/\d/	Any digit character
			/\w/	An alphanumeric character (“word character”)
			/\s/	Any whitespace character
			/./	Any character except newlines
			/\b/	A word boundary
			/^/	Start of input
			/$/	End of input

			// So lets go over creating a regular expression
			/* A regular expression is a type of object created with a RegExp constructor or as a literal value by enclosing forward slashes "/" */
			var re1 = new RegExp("abc");
			var re2 = /abc/; //
			var eighteenPlus = /eighteen\+/; // Remember, operators, symbols, etc. have different meanings in regular expressions. So add a back slash to imply no meaning

			// Now lets test for matches
			/* Regular expressions have another of methods. Lets start with using test! */
			console.log(/abc/.test("abcde")); // Should output as -> true - because the string contains a match of the pattern in the expression
			console.log(/abc/.test("abxde")); // Should output as -> false

			// Now lets match a set of characters
			/* Finding out whether a string contains "abc" can be done with a call to indexOf. But regular expressions allow us to go beyond that and express more
			complicated patterns. Both of the following expressions match all strings that contain a digit */
			console.log(/[0123456789]/.test("in 1992")); // Should output as -> true because there numbers matching in the pattern
			console.log(/[0-9]/.test("in 1992")); // Also should output as -> true
			/* Within square brackets, a dash (-) between two characters can be used to indicate a range of characters, where the ordering is determined by the
			characters unicode number. Characters 0-9 sit next to each other on the unicode chart (codes 48-57). Heres a list of shortcuts you can use instead of
			typing [0-9] or [a-c]

			\d = Any digit -> so you could use \d instead of [0-9]
			\w = Any alphanumeric character (Letters and numbers)
			\W = Any nonalphanumeric character (Symbols, no letters or numbers)
			\s = Any whitespace character (spaces, newline, etc.)
			\D = Any character that is not a number
			\S = Any nonwhitespace character (Letters, numbers, and symbols)
			. = Any character except for \n

			Heres another example of using shortcuts
			*/
			var dateTime = /\d\d-\d\d-\d\d\d\d/; // It tends to not look very pretty to write, but we'll cover making it nicer to read later!
			console.log(dateTime.test("11-12-1993")); // Should output as -> true
			console.log(dateTime.test("November-12-1993")); // Should output as -> false
			/* To invert a set of characters, as in to express that you want to match any character EXCEPT the ones in the set, use a caret (^) */
			var notBinary = /[^01]/;
			console.log(notBinary.test("1100100")); // Should output -> false, because we are looking for any characters except the indicated in the set
			console.log(notBinary.test("1100230")); // Should output -> true, because a 2 and 3 which are not included in the set are being passed

			// Now lets go over repeating parts of a pattern
			/* We know how to match a single digits and letters, what about matching a whole sequence of numbers or letters? When you put a plus sign after something
			in a regular expression, it indicates that the element may be repeated more than once. Thus /\d+/ matches one or more digit characters */
			console.log(/'\d+'/.test("'123'")); // Should output -> true since more than one number is showing up
			console.log(/'\d+'/.test("''")); // Should return -> false since nothing was found
			console.log(/'\d*'/.test("'123")); // Should return -> true // the asterisk* is similar to + except it also allows the pattern to match 0 times.
			// a question mark ? makes part of a pattern optional, meaning it may occur zero or one time. Here is an example
			var neighbor = /neighbou?r/; // The ? makes the "u" letter optional when checking for matches
			console.log(neighbor.test("neighbour")); // Should return as -> true
			console.log(neighbor.test("neighbor")); // Should return as -> true
			/* To indicate that a pattern should occur multiple times, use {} curly braces. Putting a {4} requires the pattern to occur exactly 4 times to be true,
			and when specifying a range in this notation {2, 4}, it means the element must occur at least twice, and at most four times. And using {5, } indicates
			to match if pattern detected 5 or more times. Check the example: */
			var dateTime = /\d{1,2}-\d{1,2}-\d{4}/; // Allow either 1-2 digits for the month, same with day, and only four digits for the year
			console.log(dateTime.test("11-12-1993")); // Output should be -> true
			console.log(dateTime.test("11-12-93")); // Output should be -> false

			// Now lets cover grouping subexpressions
			/* You can use an operator like * or + on more than one element at a time by using parentheses */
			var CartoonCrying = /boo+(hoo+)+/i;
			console.log(CartoonCrying.test("Boohoohoo")); // Output should be -> true
			/* So the regular expression indicates to find the patterns boo and hoo. The first and second + characters only apply to the second o in boo and hoo,
			and the third applies to the whole group to also include the last "o". The "i" at the end of the sequence indicates that the expression is case
			insensitive, so when testing the capital B still matches with the regular expression! */

			// Now lets cover matches and groups
			/* Now the test method is great and all, but its use is only limited to a boolean return value. Regular expressions also have an "execute" method that
			will return null if no match is found, and return an object with information about the match otherwise! */
			var match = /\d+/.exec("one two 100");
			console.log(match); // Should output the element -> ["100"]
			console.log(match.index); // Should output the location in the string where the string successfully matches -> 8
			// The match method behaves similarly
			console.log("one two 100".match(/\d+/)); // Should output ["100"]
			/* When a regular expression contains a subexpression grouped with parentheses, the text that matched those groups will also show up in the array.
			The whole match is always the first element, the next element is the part matched by the first group, and then second group then so on. */
			var quotedText = /'([^']*)'/;
			console.log(quotedText.exec("she said 'hello'")); // -> ["'hello'", "hello"]
			/* When a group is not matched at all, it returns in the array as undefined */

			// Now lets go over the date type
			/* Javascript has a standard object for representing dates, or rather poins in time called Date. You can use it to get the current date and time! */
			console.log(new Date()); // -> the current date and time
			// You can also create a date object with specific times
			console.log(new Date(2009, 11, 9)); // Should output -> Wed Dec 09 2009 00:00:00
			console.log(new Date(2009, 11, 9, 12, 59, 59, 999)); // Should output -> Wed Dec 09 2009 12:59:59
			// You can then use the getTime method on the date object that returns a number
			console.log(new Date(2013, 11, 19).getTime()); // Should return the date in milliseconds haha -> 1387429200000
			console.log(new Date(1387429200000)); // Should return -> Thu Dec 19 2013 00:00:00
			/* The Date objects provides for methods like getFullYear, getMonth, getDate, getHours, getMinutes, and getSeconds, and getYear(returns two digits like 93)
			so now lets create a date object from a string */
			function findDate(string) {
				var dateTime = /(\d{1,2})-(\d{1,2})-(\d{4})/;
				var match = dateTime.exec(string);
				return new Date(Number(match[3])),
							   (Number(match[2])) - 1,
							   (Number(match[1]));
			}
			console.log(findDate("30-1-2003")); /* Okay this part isn't working properly, come back to it later! */

			// Now lets cover Word and String Boundaries
			/* Sometimes we need to enforce that a match must span part or the whole string. We can add ^ and $ markerts. The caret ^ matches the start of the input
			string, while the $ matches the end. So /^\d+$/ matches a string consisting entirely of one or more digits, /^!/ matches any string that starts with an
			exclamation mark, and /x^/ does not match any string since there cannot be an x before the start of a string. We can also use \b to set a word boundary,
			where a word boundary can be the start or end of the string or any pint in the string that has a work character on one side and a nonword character on the
			other */
			console.log(/cat/.test("concatenate")); // Should output -> true
			console.log(/\bcat\b/.test("concatenate")); // Should output -> false

			// Now lets cover choice patterns
			/* Say we want to know whether a piece of text contains not only a number but a number by one of the words pig, cow, or chicken, or any of its plural forms,
			you can use the pipe character (|) to do this */
			var animalCount = /\b\d+ (pig|cow|chicken)s?\b/;
			console.log(animalCount.test("15 pigs")); // Should output -> true
			console.log(animalCount.test("15 pigchickens")); // Should output -> false

			// Now lets cover the replace method
			/* Replace does exactly what you think, and replaces matched parts of a given string with another string */
			console.log("papa".replace("p", "m")); // Should output -> mapa
			// You can use the "g" option (for global) for all matches to be replaced, not just the first match
			console.log("Borobudur".replace(/[ou]/, "a")); // Should output -> Barobudar
			console.log("Borobudur".replace(/[ou]/g, "a")); // Should output -> Barabadar
			/* How about taking a list of names, and organizing them into First Name, Last Name format? */
			console.log("Hopper, Grace\nMcCarthy, John\nRitchie, Dennis".replace(/([\w]+), ([\w]+)/g, "$2 $1")); // Output -> Grace Hopper John McCarthy ...etc.
			/* So okay alot of this is understandable, but what about the $2 and $1 argument? The $1 and $2 in the replacement string refers to the parenthesized
			groups in the pattern, and it can go up to $9! The whole match can be referred to with $&.You can also pass a function instead of a string as the
			second argument to replace. Heres an example: */
			var s = "the cia and fbi";
			console.log(s.replace(/\b(fbi|cia)\b/g, function(str) {
				return str.toUpperCase();
			})); // Should output -> the CIA and FBI

			// Heres an example that strips comments from passed in code
			function stripComments(code) {
				return code.replace(/\/\/.*|\/\*[^]*?\*\//g, "");
			}
			console.log(stripComments("x+1; // Heres a comment!")); // Should output -> x+1;
			console.log(stripComments("x*9; /* Heres a multi-line comment */")); // Should output -> x*9;

			// Lets cover dynamically creating RegExp objects
			/* There are some cases where you might not know the exact pattern you need to match against because the user has to input the information
			first since you can't use backslash notation when the program is running. You can use the RegExp constructor covered eaelier. */
			var name = "harry";
			var text = "Harry is a suspicious character.";
			var regexp = new RegExp("\\b(" + name + ")\\b", "gi");
			console.log(text.replace(regexp, "_$1_")); // Should output -> _Harry_ is a suspicious character.
			/* When creating a \b boundary marker, we have two backslashes because we are writing them in a normal string, not a slash-enclosed regular expression.
			The second argument to the RegExp constructor contains the options for the regular expression - in this case "gi" for global and case-insensitive */

			// Now lets go over the search method
			/* idexOf method on strings cannot be called with a regular expression, so we use the search method instead which returns the first index on which
			the expression was found, or a -1 when its not found */
			console.log("  word".search(/\S/)); // Output -> 2 // Remember that \S looks for any character, including whitespace
			console.log("     ".search(/\S/)); // Output -> -1

			// Now lets go over the LastIndex property
			/* The exec method similarly does not provide a convenient way to start searching from a given position in the string. Well it does, but in an
			inconvenient way.  */
			var pattern = /y/g;
			pattern.lastIndex = 3;
			var match = pattern.exec("xyzzy");
			console.log(match.index); // Output -> 4
			console.log(pattern.lastIndex); // Output -> 5

			// Now lets cover looping over matches!
			/* A common pattern to use is to scan through all the occurences of a pattern in a string */
			var input = "A string with 3 numbers in it... 42 and 88.";
			var number = /\b(\d+)\b/g;
			var match;
			while (match = number.exec(input))
				console.log("Found", match[1], "at", match.index); //Output -> Found 3 at 14... etc.

			// Lets cover the basic process of parsing an INI file
			/* So heres the example .ini file:
			searchengine=http://www.google.com/search?q=$1
			spitefulness=9.7

			; comments are preceded by a semicolon...
			; each section concerns an individual enemy
			[larry]
			fullname=Larry Doe
			type=kindergarten bully
			website=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/11451

			[gargamel]
			fullname=Gargamel
			type=evil sorcerer
			outputdir=/home/marijn/enemies/gargamel

			So we want to read an INI file with the following rules:
				- Blank lines and lines staring with semicolons are ignored
				- Lines wrapped in [ and  ] start a new section 
				- Lines containing alphanumeric indentifier followed by an = character add a setting to the current section
				- Anything else is invalid

			To start, we want to split the file into seperate lines, so using string.split("\n") will do the trick, and we can use a regular expression
			along with \n so we'll use /\r?\n/ to split in a way that allows both \n and \r\n between lines */
			function parseINI(string) {
				// Start with an object to hold the top level fields
				var CurrentSection = {name: null, fields: []};
				var categories = [CurrentSecion];

				string.split(/\r?\n/).forEach(function(line) {
					var match;
					if (/^\s*(;.*)?$/.test(line)) { // If a comment is detected, do nothing
						return;
					} 
					else if (match = line.match(/^\[(.*)\]$/)) { // If square brackets were found, start a section
						currentSection = {name: match[1], fields: []};
						categories.push(CurrentSection);
					}
					else if (match = line.match(/^(\w+)=(.*)$/)) { // If a command with an equal sign, and some more characters are found, perform condition
						currentSection.fields.push({name: match[1], value: match[2]});
					}
					else {
						// There has been an error, pass in the line where the INI code is invalid
						throw new Error("Line '" + line + "' is invalid");
					}
				});

				return categories;
			}
			/* Now keep in mind the function won't actually be used, its just to go over how it would work */
