<!--
	Finally, we get to break up programs into pieces and load them from files. 
	Wait... so this section doesn't cover that... I thought modules were seperate files...
	Eh I'll look it up later. Oh you just use the properties of HTML haha. Okay then

	This section covers modules!

			function dayName(number) {
				return names[number];

			console.log(dayName(1)); // Output -> Monday
			/* The dayName function is part of the modules interface, but the names variable is not. We would prefer not to spill it into the global scope. 
			So lets try this: */
			var dayName = function() {
				var names = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
				return function(number) {
					return names[number];
				};
			}(); // Okay don't let the extra parenthesis confuse you, the empty parenthesis here is to execute the anonymous function
			console.log(dayName(3));
			/* Now names is a local variable (inside an unnamed function). Now lets use a similar pattern to isolate code from the outside world entirely. The module
			below logs a value to the console but does not actually provide any values for other modules to see */
			(function() {
				function square(x) {return x * x; }
				var hundred = 100;

				console.log(square(hundred));
			})(); // The extra parenthesis execute the anonymous function

			// Okay this section covers technical parts of namespacing... I know I should probably look at it, I'd like to move to modifying the DOM...I'll do the rest later
