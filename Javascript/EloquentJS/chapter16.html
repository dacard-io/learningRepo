		<!-- There are two alternatives to drawing on the screen. The first is using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) and the other is drawing on canvas. SVGs are
		DOM based, while Canvas is a single DOM element that gives an interface to draw onto it. -->

		<!-- Lets cover SVGs -->
		<p>Normal HTML here</p>
		<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> <!-- The xlmns attribute changes to a different XML namespace, the URL specified changes the dialect the SVGs are read in -->
			<circle r="50" cx="50" cy="50" fill="red" />
			<rect x="120" y="5" width="90" height="90" stroke="blue" fill="none"/>
			<!-- <circle> and <rect> tags obviously don't exist in HTML, but exist in the SVG dialect. This book won't cover SVGs in detail, but a only an overview -->
		</svg>
			<script>
				var circle = document.querySelector("circle");
				circle.setAttribute("fill", "cyan");
			</script>

		<!-- Now lets cover the Canvas element -->
		<p>Before canvas</p>
		<canvas width="800" height="860"></canvas>
		<!-- When no width or height is set for canvas, it gets a default size of 300 pixels wide by 150 pixels high -->
		<p>After canvas</p>
			<script>
				var canvas = document.querySelector("canvas"); // Select the canvas object
				var context = canvas.getContext("2d"); // Create the context object and bind to the canvas object. There is 2d, and webgl for 3D
				context.fillStyle = "red"; // Set fill style to red
				context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 50); // Fill the canvas object - arguments, (x, y, width, height)
			</script>
			<!-- As a note, multiple canvas' can in some cases improve overall performance. Quick example. Lets say you have a game, with two canvases. One canvas
			holds the background of the game, and the other canvas holds all moving objects. This setup would be better because you everytime you change the canvas,
			its redrawn, so if you were to have everything in one canvas, the background has to be redrawn for no reason. Having a seperate canvas will prevent redrawing
			an entire background over and over again. -->

		<!-- Now lets cover filling and stroking -->
			<script>
				var cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d"); // Bind cx to the canvas object, and set the context to 2d
				cx.strokeStyle = "blue"; // Set the stroke or line along the border to color blue - any CSS color is understood here
				cx.strokeRect(5, 5, 50, 50); // Stroke a rectangle at position (5,5) 50 pixels wide, and 50 pixels long
				cx.lineWidth = 5; //Set line width of the stroke to 5px
				cx.strokeRect(135, 5, 50, 50); // Stroke another rectangle at another position 
			</script>

		<!-- Now lets cover paths -->
			<script>
				var path_cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d"); // Bind path_cs to the canvas object and set the context to 2d
				path_cx.beginPath(); // Use beginPath to create a path (line)
				for (var y = 10; y < 100; y += 10) { // Use a for loop to create multiple lines at different y coordinates
					path_cx.moveTo(10, y); // Use the moveTo function to designate the start of the line segment
					path_cx.lineTo(90, y); // Use lineTo to designate the end of the line segment
				}
				path_cx.stroke(); // And finally use stroke to create create the path

				// Here is another example - a triangle
				path_cx.beginPath();
				path_cx.moveTo(50, 10);
				path_cx.lineTo(10, 70);
				path_cx.lineTo(90, 70);
				path_cx.fill(); // Fill the path created - you can also end the path by using closePath()
			</script>

		<!-- Now lets go over curves -->
		<!-- Curves require a little bit more involvement. Use the quadraticCurveTo method to draw a curve at a given point. To determine the curve, the method is given
		a control point as well as a destination point. The control point is the point the line attracts to, never actually touching it, giving the line its curve. -->
			<script>
				var curve_cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d"); // Bind curve_cx to the canvas element, and give it a 2D context
				curve_cx.beginPath(); // So you begin drawing the path
				curve_cx.moveTo(10,90); // Indicate the starting point
				// Control = (60, 10) goal = (90, 90)
				curve_cx.quadraticCurveTo(60, 10, 90, 90); // Create the curve
				curve_cx.lineTo(60,10); // Draw to this point
				curve_cx.closePath(); // End the path
				curve_cx.stroke(); // Stroke the path

				/* There are more types of curves such as bezierCurveTo(), and arc() and arcTo(), but we can cover this later! We have to cover alot of information */
			</script>

		<!-- Now lets go over drawing a pie chart - from Customer survey data -->
			<script>
				var results = [
					{name: "Satisfied", count: 1043, color: "lightblue"},
					{name: "Neutral", count: 563, color: "lightgreen"},
					{name: "Unsatisfied", count: 510, color: "pink"},
					{name: "No Comment", count: 175, color: "silver"}
				];

				var pie = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
				var total = results.reduce(function(sum, choice) {
					return sum + choice.count;
				}, 0);
				// Start at the top
				var currentAngle = -0.5 * Math.PI;
				results.forEach(function(result) {
					var sliceAngle = (result.count / total) * 2 * Math.PI;
					pie.beginPath();
					// Center=100, 100, radius = 100
					// From current angle, clockwise by slice's angle
					pie.arc(100, 100, 100, currentAngle, currentAngle + sliceAngle);
					currentAngle += sliceAngle;
					pie.lineTo(100, 100);
					pie.fillStyle = result.color;
					pie.fill();
				}); // [HE MADE A SERIES OF MOVEMENTS AND THE BALL WENT INTO THE BASKET]
			</script>

		<!-- Now lets go over drawing text on the canvas -->
			<script>
				var text = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
				text.font = "28px Georgia";
				text.fillStyle = "fuchsia";
				text.fillText("I CAN DO TEXT!", 250, 50) // Arguments (message, X, Y)
			</script>

		<!-- Now lets go over drawing images -->
			<script>
				/* Lets use the drawImage method to draw pixel data onto the canvas. In this example, we're going to draw a bunch of hats*/
				var image = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d"); // Bind the image variable to the canvas
				var img = document.createElement("img"); // Create an img element
				img.src = "http://freepngimages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/top-hat.png"; // Set the Source url for the element
				// Now we don't want to draw the image just yet because it needs to load, so use the load event handler to do the drawing after its loaded
				img.addEventListener("load", function() { // Bind the event handler to the image element, not the canvas.
					for (var x = 10; x < 200; x += 30)
						image.drawImage(img, x, 200, 120, 100); // Draw the image element onto the canvas
						/* drawImage takes nine arguments: drawImage(img,sx,sy,swidth,sheight,x,y,width,height); 
							img = The image, canvas, or video element to use
							sx = *optional. The x coordinate where to start clipping
							sy = *optional. The y coordinate where to start clipping
							swidth = *optional. The width of the clipped image
							sheight = *optional. The height of the clipped image
							x = The x coordinate where to place the image on the canvas
							y = The y coordinate where to place the image on the canvas
							width = *optional, The width of the image to use
							height = *optional. The height of the image to use. */
				});

				/* Now lets use a sprite sheet to animate it */
				var player = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d"); // Bind the player variable to the canvas, and set context to 2D
				var image = document.createElement("img"); // Create an img element and bind it to the image variable
				image.src = "chapter16_sprite.png"; // Set the image source
				var spriteW = 24, spriteH = 30; // Set the sprite's width and height
				image.addEventListener("load", function() { // Bind event handler to image, then when resource loaded, perform function
					var cycle = 0; // Set cycle to equal 0
					setInterval(function() { // Create an interval (a repeating timer)
						player.clearRect(200, 300, spriteW, spriteH);
						player.drawImage(image, cycle * spriteW, 0, spriteW, spriteH, 200, 300, spriteW, spriteH);
						cycle = (cycle + 1) % 8;
					}, 90) // Run at 90 milliseconds per interval
				});
			</script>

		<!-- Now lets go over transformations -->
			<script>
				/* You can use transformations to do anything from stretching and shrinking, rotating, warping, and horizontal/vertical flipping, and more. For example
				are sprite only looks like its walking right. What about left? You can make another set of sprites, but why would you want to do that. You can use
				transformations for that kind of thing */
				var transform = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
				transform.scale(3, .5);
				transform.beginPath();
				transform.arc(50, 50, 40, 0, 7);
				transform.lineWidth = 3;
				transform.stroke()
				/* Scale will cause everything about the drawn image including the line width, to be stretched out or squeezed together as specified. Scaling by
				a negative amount will flip the image. So scale(-1, 1) will flip the image, but it will flip you out of the canvas. You can deal with this by adjusting
				the coordinates to the image object back into the canvas, but thats just more work. So we are going to use the other methods to make it easier. */
				transform.translate(around, 0);
				transform.scale(-1, 1);
				transform.translate(-around, 0);
			</script>
		<!-- Now lets cover storing and clearing transformations -->
			<script>
				var transform = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
				transform.save(); // Use the save method to save the current transformation on the object
				transform.restore(); // Use restore to restore a saved transformation to this object
			</script>
