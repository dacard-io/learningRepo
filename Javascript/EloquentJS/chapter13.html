			/* Lets start with some notes. The DOM has global variables that can be used (and you see them all the time). "document" gives access to
			all of the DOM's objects and "documentElement" refers to objects representing the <html> tag, and has properties for <head> and <body>.

			The DOM can be visualized as a tree, with document.documentElement as the root. Elements can have nodes and child nodes, such an example is
			document.body. Each DOM node has a nodeType property, which contains a numeric code to identify the node. Regular elements have the value 1,
			and can be also defined as the constant property document.ELEMENT_NODE, and also document.TEXT_NODE (which have the value of 3) for a section 
			of text in the document, and document.COMMENT_NODE which has a value of 8. But using numeric codes for each node would suck to use. So this is
			just information you can use. */

			// Now lets cover finding elements
			/* Lets get the href link on the page, but only the first one */
			var link = document.body.getElementsByTagName("a")[0]; // Get only the first instance of it
			console.log(link.href); // Print out the url of the link
			/* The problem with this method is that if you were to change the order of the link to another part of the page, hard coding the array would cause
			some issues and features would break. So you can also specifically choose an item by an id attribute and a class attribute! */
			var beachball = document.getElementById("beachball"); // Don't need to use body in this one, since your not going through the DOM tree
			console.log(beachball.src); // Output the image url of the beachball element
			var basketball = document.getElementsByClassName("basketball")[0]; // So classes are read as an array, ID is specific to one object
			console.log(basketball.src);

			// Now lets go over changing the document
			/* Everything about the DOM data structure can be changed. The removeChild method removes the given child node from the document. To add a child node,
			you use the appendChild method, which puts a node at the end of the list of children, or insertBefore, which inserts a node given as the first argument before
			the node given as the second argument. */
			var paragraphs =document.getElementsByClassName("paragraphs");
			document.body.insertBefore(paragraphs[2], paragraphs[0]); // Will rearrange the <p> tags with the class paragraphs to output -> three one two
			/* You can also use replaceChild to replace a child node with another one. It takes two arguments, a new node, and the node to be replaced. Remember that
			replaceChild and insertBefore expect the new node as their first argument */

			// Now lets go over creating new nodes
			/* Lets write a small script that replaces all <img> tags with the text held at their alt attributes */
			function replaceImages() {
				var images = document.body.getElementsByTagName("img");
				for (var i = images.length -1; i >= 0; i--) {
					var image = images[i];
					if (image.alt) { // If an alt property exists
						var text = document.createTextNode(image.alt); // CreateTextNode creates a type 3 DOM Node (a text node) which will insert into the document and show
						image.parentNode.replaceChild(text, image);
					}
				}
			}
			replaceImages(); // Run the function
			/* To create a regular type 1 node, you can use document.CreateElement which takes a tag name, and returns a new empty nod of the given type. The following example defines a utility "elt" which creates an element node and treats the rest of the arguments as children of that node. This function then is used to add
			a simple attribution to a quote. */
			function elt(type) {
				var node = document.createElement(type);
				for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) {
					var child = arguments[i];
					if (typeof child == "string")
						child = document.createTextNode(child);
					node.appendChild(child);
				}
				return node;
			}
			document.getElementById("quote").appendChild(
				elt("footer", "-", 
					elt("strong", "Karl Popper"), 
					", preface to the second edition of ", 
					elt("em", "The Open Society"), 
					"1950"
				)
			);

			// Lets go over attributes
			/* HTML allows you to set your own attribute names so there is no interference with properties of the DOM */
			var paras = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p");
			Array.prototype.forEach.call(paras, function(para) {
				if (para.getAttribute("data-classified") == "secret")
					para.parentNode.removeChild(para);
			}); // This was a more complex way of doing things, but regardless it hides any <p> element with the data-classified attribute set to secret

			/* Okay so the book provides more in-depth examples on these concepts, but the truth is the concepts are pretty simple to begin with, so we can take it
			easy on typing out each page of the fuckin book jesus christ */

			// Lets cover layout
			/* Okay this section covers CSS layouts in Javascript, honestly I already know how to do this, and I should just keep a reference of some of the attributes
			associated: left, right, offsetWidth, offsetHeight, pageXOffSet, pageYOffset. Just get a reference for all of them */ 
			var layoutP = document.getElementById("layoutP"); // Set variable to equal an element
			console.log("clientHeight: ", layoutP.clientHeight); // Output the client height, or size of space inside element in px
			console.log("clientWidth: ", layoutP.clientWidth); // Output the client width, or size of space inside element in px
			console.log("getBoundingClientRect: ", layoutP.getBoundingClientRect());
			/* Here some of the basic CSS DOM properties that can be modified:
				offsetWidth/offsetHeight = the space the element takes up in pixels
				clientWidth/clientHeight = the size of space inside the element in pixels
				getBoundingClientRect() = Gives precise position of element with top/bottom/left/right pixels and width/height
				pageXOffset/pageYOffset = Gives the X and Y axis scroll position!
			
			Remember, a program that repeatedly alternates between DOM layout information and changing the DOM forces a lot of layouts to happen, and will consequently
			run slowly no matter how fast your computer is. Here are two examples of this

			Naive slow version:
			time("naive", function() {
			    var target = document.getElementById("one");
			    while (target.offsetWidth < 2000)
			    target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("X"));
			}); // → naive took 32 ms
			  
			Clever fast version: 
			time("clever", function() {
			    var target = document.getElementById("two");
			    target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("XXXXX"));
			    var total = Math.ceil(2000 / (target.offsetWidth / 5));
			    for (var i = 5; i < total; i++)
			    target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("X"));
			}); // → clever took 1 ms
			*/
			// Lets now cover styling
			/* You can modify the CSS of objects using the style property! You kinda already know how this works. You can put an inline style attribute into your
			HTML code, but you can also do so with Javascript, and the world becomes your oyster. There are properties for every single CSS style, so look up a reference
			to all of them later. I'm just going to quickly go over how to use them! 

			Here are some more you can use(not all of them, just some. You should already know how to use these CSS properties):
			position	color	background	cursor	animation
			border/borderBottom/borderBottomLeftRadius/borderBottomStyle/borderBottomWidth
			top/bottom/left/right	display		height/width
			display		margin/marginBottom		maxHeight/maxWidth
			minHeight/minWidth		overflow	padding/paddingleft
			textAlign	textOverflow	textDecoration		textTransform
			transform   transition		zIndex		listStyle

			Like I said there are way more of them, but these are some important ones
			*/
			var changeStyle = document.getElementsByTagName("p")[2];
			changeStyle.style.color = "blue"; // Change the color of the "Three" paragraph color to blue!

			// Now lets go over query selectors
			/* The querySelectorAll method defined on both the document object and element nodes, takes a selector string and returns an array like object containing
			all the elements that were matched */
			function count(selector) {
				return document.querySelectorAll(selector).length;
			}
			console.log(count("p")); // Should output the number of all <p> elements
			console.log(count(".animal")); // Should output the number of .animal classes, which should be 2 from the span's
			console.log(count("p .animal")); // Should output the number of .animal classes inside of all <p> tags, which should be 2
			console.log(count("p > .animal")); // The number of .animal classes that are a direct child of <p>, which should be 2
			/* You can also use the querySelector method if you want a specific single element. It will return only the matching element, or null if no elements
			match. Unlike methods such as getElementsByTagName, the object returned by querySelectorAll is not live, as in, it won't change the document. */
			/* Haha so I don't necassarily need JQuery for selectors...but JQuery gives you a host of compatibility fixes so you should still probably
			use it. It also has tons of animations and fancy widgets */

			// Now lets cover positioning and animating [*breathing and zeal intensifies*]
			/* So lets create an animation */
			var dog = document.querySelector(".dog");
			var angle = 0, lastTime = null; 
			function animate(time) { // animate is passed the current time as an argument
				if (lastTime != null)
					angle += (time - lastTime) * 0.001; // .001 is milliseconds! so its a smoother animation
				lastTime = time;
				dog.style.top = (Math.sin(angle) * 20) + "px"; // We're going to do a rotation. So you have to use trig. Damn I should probably brush up on math
				dog.style.left = (Math.cos(angle) * 200) + "px"; // The units are default in em, so we have to append "px" to set the unit
				requestAnimationFrame(animate); //requestAnimationFrame schedules the animation function to run when the browser is ready to repaint the screen
			}
			requestAnimationFrame(animate);

			/* And that concludes this chapter. This section was a hell of alot of fun. For me at least, working with the console can be incredibly boring, and you
			don't see results like you would on the DOM. Next section covers timers, event listeners, etc. Its about to get alot more interesting */
